# VibeScout - Personalized Recommendation Website

This project aims to build a personalized recommendation website that helps users decide on places to visit or dine at, based on their Spotify listening data and reviews of specific locations. Users can either input a specific place they're thinking of visiting, and the website will generate a summary of whether they might like it (based on reviews and keywords), or they can ask the website to suggest a list of places they might enjoy.

## Goals
- **Primary Goal**: Determine whether there is a meaningful relationship between Spotify listening habits and user reviews of locations.
  - Specifically, the focus will be on how audio features (e.g., energy, valence) and playlist types might predict a userâ€™s likelihood to enjoy a place based on keyword and sentiment analysis of place reviews.
- **Secondary Goal**: Develop the capability for suggesting a list of potential places based on the user's music preferences.

## Data Collection
- **Spotify API Data**:
  - Collect user data such as top tracks and audio features.
  - Audio features will inform the user's general vibe and help categorize them by mood or energy.
- **Review and Keyword Data**: Gather reviews and locations of places from the Google Places API. Focus on keywords and sentiment extracted from reviews, which can then be cross-referenced with audio features from Spotify to find potential patterns.


## Modeling
Currently, the model I am using is content-based filtering to match the user's spotify profile with place attributes based on the similarity of feature vectors.
- **Feature Vectors for Places**: I construct feature vectors for each place based on sentiment analysis and TF-IDF keyword frequencies derived from reviews.
- **Similarity Calculation**: I use cosine similarity to calculate the similarity score between the user's Spotify preferences and each place's feature vector. Places with higher similarity scores are considered better matches.
- **Model Architecture**
  - User Vector: constructed using normalized Spotify data (with data such as energy, valence, danceability, etc. in the top tracks)
  - Place Vector: constructed using attributes from Google Places reviews (such as cleanliness, friendliness, etc.)
  - Cosine Similarity: used to quantify the "closeness" of a place to the user's preferences

These are some possibilities for me to additionally use to get more specific/accurate predictions for places to go:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Using a matrix factorization approach (e.g. SVD or ALS), I would implement user-item collaborative filtering to predict a user's preference for unvisited places based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Hybrid Model (Collaborative + Content-Based)**: This model would combine collaborative filtering which looks at user preferences based on behavior with content-based filtering which looks at place features based on reviews. The CF (collaborative filtering) model would recommend places based on user similarity while refining recommendations using content-based features (keywords, sentiment) from the CBF (content-based filtering) model.

## Data Visualization
This is the current status of my visualizations on my webpage.
- **Interactive Map Visualization (Google Maps Data)**: An interactive map where users can see their previously visited locations marked with different icons for what type of place it is (like restaurant or attraction) and potential new recommendations highlighted. You would be able to hover over each place for a brief summary. This currently works to be initialized to a user's location but is still not working yet to show the little location markers.
- **Word Cloud/Review Summaries**: A dynamic word cloud that summarizes the top keywords extracted from the reviews of places the user is considering that has frequently mentioned words. Hoping to make this more dynamic.
- **Bar Chart (User Preferences vs. Recommendations)**: bar chart that compares the user's Spotify-derived preferences for features like valence, energy, loudness, ambiance, and liveness with the corresponding features of a searched up specific place. The side-by-side comparison helps visualize how well each place aligns with the user's personal "vibe."

These are visualizations I'd like to add:
- **Likelihood Plot**: Visualization that shows how likely a user is to enjoy a specific place or activity based on reviews and keywords. Some nice features to add would be to have an interactive slider where users can adjust certain preferences (like distance, rating threshold, or keywords) and the plot will dynamically update and a "confidence meter" that shifts in real-time showing the model's confidence for that recommendation. Visualization on how well a place matches their mood or music taste (e.g., based on energy level or genre preferences). Maybe like a gauge.

## Test Plan
This is just in case I end up needing it later for training.
- **Test/Train Split**: 70-80% of the data for training, 20-30% for testing
- **Evaluation and Testing**:
  - **Metrics for Evaluation**: precision at K, mean average precision (MAP), root mean squared error (RMSE), hit rate
  - **Testing Plan** (possible options): holdout testing, A/B testing (comparing two different models), k-folds (? not sure if this works for non CNNs (convolutional neural networks)), majority voting algorithm

## Data Processing
**Spotify Data Processing**
- Feature Extraction: I retrieve features from the user's top tracks using the Spotify API. Each track's valence, energy, loudness, ambiance, and liveness values are averaged to create a single "user preferences" profile.
- Normalization: User preferences are normalized to a 0-1 scale where necessary to facilitate comparison with place attributes

**Google Places Data Processing**
- Review Collection: using the Google Places API, I collect reviews (5 of them) for each place within a specified radius (5, 10, 15 miles) of the user's location
- Sentiment Analysis: each review text is analyzed to calculate a sentiment score, which contributes to an overall sentiment score for the place
- Keyword Extraction: use TF-IDF (term frequency inverse document frequency) to identify important keywords in reviews, providing context to user feedback on each place
- Feature Vector Generation: for each place, a feature vector is build comprimising an average sentiment score, sentiment variance, average review length, and keyword frequencies

## Preliminary Results
1. **Similarity Scores**: my initial results yield similarity scores for each recommended place within a specified radius from the user, with being able to generate even more specific values within the feature vector (for features such as cleanliness) as well. places with keywords or review sentiment aligning with the user's spotify profile seem to have higher scores.
2. **Diverse Recommendations**: initial results seem to indicate a variety of place types in the recommendations which seem to indicate that the link with the google places api is working with finding actual places that the user might like, though the only issue right now is making sure that the calculation is being done well and is optimized to calculate similarity best.
3. **Visual Results on Figures**: keywords from the reviews of a specified place seem to be generated effectively and understand "negativeness" or "positiveness" well as well as other nuances in keywords and bring out keywords that are important. additionally, it seems that the overall user profile for a user's spotify listening is successfully averagely quantifiable into the bar graph and the average sentiment is also able to be generally compared well with the user's profile. because of seeing a possibility of a match across multiple categories with the user's profile as well as an absolute no match i think there could be a relationship here.
